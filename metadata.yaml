description: Covering topics ranging from literature to philosophy, history to social
  criticism, this is a snapshot of thought on 20th-century Europe (and the world)
  by one of Europe's sharpest wits and ablest pens. With chapter titles ranging from
  ""The Miser and His Friends" to ""The Red Reactionary," from ""The Separatist and
  Sacred Things" to ""The New Theologian" and ""The Romantic in the Rain," this volume
  includes 39 brief sketches of individuals, each one of whom illustrates an aspect
  of contemporary society. Social, historical, and religious thought all figure prominently
  in this book,
